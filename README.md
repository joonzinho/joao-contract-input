# Private Law Society MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

[**[ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·] VersÃ£o em portuguÃªs: LEIAME.md**](LEIAME.md)

## TL;DR

PLS (Private Law Society) is a project seeking to support the creation of contracts where both parties agree on an arbitrator (or multiple arbitrators) and Bitcoin is used as collateral, so that the contract has its due enforcement. The parties send the necessary collateral to the contract, where it can be later redeemed if either:

1. Both parties agree
2. One of the parties + the arbitrators agree

This means the arbitrators can't run off with the money by themselves, but they can still financially punish the other party.
